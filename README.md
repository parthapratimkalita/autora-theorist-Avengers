# AutoRA Contribution

This template provides a step-by-step guide on how to use `cookiecutter` to create a [AutoRA](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/) contribution.

## Get Started

To start, use this template to create a repository. Depending on what type of contribution you want to create (see, [AutoRA Components](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/#features)), the naming convention for the repository is the following:

- Theorist: `autora-theorist-[name-of-your-contribution]`
- Experimentalist: `autora-experimentalist-[name-of-your-contribution]`
- Experiment Runner: `autora-experiment-runner-[name-of-your-contribution]`

In this tutorial, we will focus on creating a theorist, but the steps are similar for the other components.

After creating a repository with the name `autora-theorist-[name-of-your-contribution]`, use GitHub [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to start the tutorial.
